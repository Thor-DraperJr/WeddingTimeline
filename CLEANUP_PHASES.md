# Repository Cleanup: Phased Action Log

> **Note:** This file is a living log. All action items, findings, decisions, and approvals related to repository cleanup must be appended here as the process advances. Do not overwrite or remove previous entriesâ€”append new information to maintain a full audit trail.

This document tracks the cleanup, optimization, and consolidation of the Wedding Timeline repository using a context engineering workflow. Each phase must be completed and approved before proceeding to the next.

---

## Phase 1: Planning

**Goal:**
Identify and plan the removal of unnecessary, obsolete, or redundant files and optimize/consolidate the repo, while ensuring no loss of required functionality.

**Rationale:**
- Reduce clutter and technical debt
- Make the repo easier to maintain and navigate
- Lower risk of confusion or accidental use of outdated files

**Expected Impact:**
- Smaller, cleaner codebase
- No change to app functionality or deployment
- Improved maintainability

**Proposed Actions:**
- [ ] Inventory all files and folders
- [ ] Categorize files (required, docs, candidates for removal)
- [ ] Present proposed list for review

**Files/Folders Affected:**
<!-- List files/folders here -->

## Phase 2: In-Progress Oversight

**Notes:**
- Track progress, checks, and blockers
- Log intermediate results or decisions

**Progress Log:**
<!-- Add notes as work proceeds -->

### [2025-07-05] Phase 2: In-Progress Oversight

**Action:** Removed unused components from `src/components/` after confirming no references in main codebase.

**Files Removed:**
- src/components/EventCard_new.tsx
- src/components/WeddingTimeline_fixed.tsx
- src/components/CategoryFilter.tsx

**Rationale:**
- No references found in main components or app entry points.
- Removal reduces clutter and risk of confusion.
- No impact on app or deployment functionality.

**Approval:** User explicitly approved removal on 2025-07-05.

**Next:** Continue to monitor for any issues and proceed with further optimization as needed.

## Phase 3: Final Action & Approval

**Summary:**
- The following files are approved for removal as they are unnecessary, redundant, or violate security/best practices:
  - .env
  - .env.example
  - .env.local
  - CodeCleanup/
  - next_function.js
  - deploy.sh
- All other files have been reviewed and are required for app functionality, deployment, or documentation.
- No app functionality or deployment process will be affected by these removals.

**Approval:**
- [x] Approval granted for file removal/changes (proceeding with best judgment as per user instruction)

> **Update [2025-07-05]:**
> 
> **File Removal Protocol:**
> - By default, file removals are performed using direct file operations within the VS Code environment for auditability and rollback.
> - If files persist after attempted removal, or if the user prefers, the recommended shell command (e.g., `rm ...`) will be provided for manual execution.
> - All removals, whether automated or manual, must be logged in this document with rationale and approval.
> - This ensures a transparent, auditable, and user-controlled cleanup process.

*This phased log ensures safe, auditable, and maintainable repository cleanup. All major changes must be tracked here.*
